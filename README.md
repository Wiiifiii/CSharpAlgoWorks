# CSharpAlgorithms


### Interactive Algorithms in C#

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms written in C#. It provides an interactive console application where users can test and explore algorithms like:

- **Tree Algorithms**:
  - AVL Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **String Search Algorithms**:
  - Naive String Search
  - Rabin-Karp Algorithm
  - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
- **Recursive Algorithms**:
  - Factorial
  - Fibonacci Series
  - Power Calculation
- **Mathematical Utilities**:
  - Palindrome Check (String & Number)
- **Data Structures**:
  - Singly Linked List

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CSharpAlgorithms.git
   cd CSharpAlgorithms
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.

3. Build and run the solution.

4. Interact with the application using the console menu.

Example Algorithms
AVL Tree:

Insert and balance a series of numbers.
Example: Insert 33, 13, 53, 9, 21, 61.
Bubble Sort:

Sort an array of numbers in descending order.
Example: Input: 35, 10, 55, 20.
Naive String Search:

Search for a pattern in a string.
Example: Text: "abcxabcdabcdabcy", Pattern: "abcd".
Factorial (Recursion):

Calculate factorial for a number.
Example: 5! = 120.
